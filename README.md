# React Stream Schedule Client

Created a new react app

```bash
npx create-react-app react-scheduler-client
```

## Add React Router
```bash
yarn add react-router-dom
```

Start with clean slate so remove the following files
-App.css
-App.test.js
-Index.css
-logo.svg
-reportWebVitals.js
-setupTests.js

Also clear out App.js all but outer Div. And remove references to deleted files in index and app.js. So remove imports and function calls to those components, css and logos that were just deleted.

Start react dev server to test

```bash
yarn start
```
